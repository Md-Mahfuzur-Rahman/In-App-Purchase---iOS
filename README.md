# In-App Purchase - iOS
A simple In-App Purchase example that handles an In-App purchase, and restoring a product.

Make sure to read [Apple's In-App Purchase documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnectInAppPurchase_Guide/Chapters/Introduction.html) and use a sandbox test user to test in-app purchase, not your actual App store credentials. 

Test In-App Purchase on device, since it does not work on the iOS Simulator.

- To test in-app purchase, you need to create products to purchase and test accounts to make the purchases. iTunes Connect allows you to create and manage in-app purchases and test user accounts.
