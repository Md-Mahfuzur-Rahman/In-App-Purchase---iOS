# In-App Purchase - iOS
A simple In-App Purchase example that handles an In-App purchase, and restoring a product.
Make sure to read [Apple's IAP documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnectInAppPurchase_Guide/Chapters/Introduction.html) and test IAP on device, since IAP does not work on the iOS Simulator.
Use a Sandbox test user to test IAP, not your actual App store credentials.
